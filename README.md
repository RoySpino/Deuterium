# Deuterium
A dot Net version of Silicon Graphic's Fusion file browser

The standard file browser will shows the user a list of icons either in a single column list or in a grid of icons. SGI apparently was not satisfied with this concept. Their take on the file browser was to make a 3D environment where a file will be represented as cubes. By selecting a cube the camera would fly through the world to focus on the selected file. 

This system was popularized by the movie Jurassic park. Unfortunately that was its death blow as people believed that it was something made for the movie. 

Currently there exists a 3D replacement but its not like SGIâ€™s.  This is my rendition.
